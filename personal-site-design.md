How do you want visitors to interact with your site?
I want users to interact intuitively with the site, very simply. I want it to be very easy to access recipes and to search for things. I also want it to be fun for younger users to navigate, through use of colour and interactive elements.

It will need a good search engine, and different pages for different types of dishes/meals, each section a different colour.
